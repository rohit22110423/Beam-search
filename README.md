This is Beam Search Algorithm.
Beam Search is a heuristic search algorithm that navigates a graph by systematically expanding the most promising nodes within a constrained set. This approach combines elements of breadth-first search to construct its search tree by generating all successors at each level. However, it only evaluates and expands a set number, W, of the best nodes at each level, based on their heuristic values. This selection process is repeated at each level of the tree.

Characteristics of Beam Search
Width of the Beam (W): This parameter defines the number of nodes considered at each level. The beam width W directly influences the number of nodes evaluated and hence the breadth of the search.
Branching Factor (B): If B is the branching factor, the algorithm evaluates 
W

B
W×B nodes at every depth but selects only W for further expansion.
Completeness and Optimality: The restrictive nature of beam search, due to a limited beam width, can compromise its ability to find the best solution as it may prune potentially optimal paths.
Memory Efficiency: The beam width bounds the memory required for the search, making beam search suitable for resource-constrained environments.


How Beam Search Works?
The process of Beam Search can be broken down into several steps:

Initialization: Start with the root node and generate its successors.
Node Expansion: From the current nodes, generate successors and apply the heuristic function to evaluate them.
Selection: Select the top W nodes according to the heuristic values. These selected nodes form the next level to explore.
Iteration: Repeat the process of expansion and selection for the new level of nodes until the goal is reached or a certain condition is met (like a maximum number of levels).
Termination: The search stops when the goal is found or when no more nodes are available to expand.




LEARN-ONE-RULE Algorithm: A General-to-Specific Beam Search Approach
The LEARN_ONE_RULE function is a practical implementation of beam search designed to derive a single rule that covers a subset of examples. It utilizes a general-to-specific greedy search, guided by a performance metric to identify the most effective rule.

Algorithm Execution Flow
Start:
Initialize the node to Root_Node and Found to False.
Search Loop:
If the current node is the goal, set Found to True.
Otherwise, find successors and estimate costs, storing them in the OPEN list.
Continuously select the top WWW elements from the OPEN list for expansion.
Evaluation:
If the goal is found during expansion, return Yes.
If the search concludes without finding the goal, return No.
